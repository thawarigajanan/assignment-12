The Ram Mandir (lit. 'Rama Temple') is a partially constructed Hindu temple complex in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India.[6][7] Many Hindus believe that it is<br/> located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the mythical birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.[8][9][10] The temple was inaugurated[7] on 22 January <br/>2024 after a prana pratishtha (consecration) ceremony.[6][10] On the first day of its opening, following the consecration, the temple received a rush of over<br/> half a million visitors,[11] and after a month, the average number of visitors was reported to be "1 to 1.5 lakh on a daily basis".[12]<br/>

The site of the temple has been the subject of communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in India, as it is the former location of the Babri Masjid mosque,<br/> which was built between 1528 and 1529. The idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992.[13][14][15]<br/> In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for construction of a temple, while Muslims were given land nearby<br/> in Dhannipur in Ayodhya to construct a mosque.[16] The court referenced a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence<br/> of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic.[17]<br/>

On 5 August 2020, the bhumi pujan (transl. ground breaking ceremony) for the commencement of the construction of Ram Mandir was performed by Narendra Modi,<br/> Prime Minister of India.[18] The temple complex, currently under construction, is being supervised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust.<br/> On 22 January 2024, Modi served as the Mukhya Yajman (transl. chief patron) of rituals for the event and performed the prana pratishtha (transl. consecration) <br/>of the temple.[19][20] The prana pratishtha ceremony was organised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.[21][22]<br/>

The temple construction has been accompanied by a $10 billion plan "encompassing a new airport, revamped railway station, and township development" to transform<br/> the ancient Ayodhya city into a global religious and spiritual tourist destination.[23][24] The temple has also attracted a number of controversies due to<br/> alleged misuse of donation, sidelining of its major activists, and politicisation of the temple by the Bharatiya Janata Party<br/>
